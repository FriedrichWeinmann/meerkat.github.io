A litter includes about two to four cubs. The wearing time is on average 77 days. At birth, the eyes and ears of the young are closed. They only open after two weeks. The young animals are suckled for the first two months. Meerkats are sexually mature after about a year. Meerkats can raise young up to three times a year. This is possible because all members of the colony support each other in breeding. Meerkats are about six years old.
